// -- INTRODUCTION -- 

Why hello there!!

My name is !!@$#$%$&@%@$##@, but you can just call me TV

...How strange that such people like you spend their nights in abandonned houses...

just... To be scared to death.

Speaking of death, I'd like to play a game with ya!

A game about treats, strategy and treason.

the first edition of Trick or Trade!

trust me; it is more fun than talking to a old TV!


// -- Tutorial -- 

Allow me to explain the rules

Each player have a deck of 30 cards

23 of them are usefull 7 of them are worthless

those 7 cards are your amout of treats

useless, but yet important

they represents... your HP!

if you manage to take all my treats card away, you won the round!

...But, if I take all your treat cards away... Well, I'll explain later.

the 23 other cards consists of trick cards and action cards

those cards are your only line of defence

each of them have a unique effect that can change the game

use them wisely and efficantly...

each turns starts by drawing a card from your deck

then, you can decide to use a card or to trade with the opponant

after your trade, you can use a card again if you so choose

and then, it's the end of your turn

most cards, when their effects are over, are send into the discard pile at your right!

What is this ashtray you may ask? Well I just invented it to spice things up.

this ashtray represents your destroyed card

destroyed cards cannot be rend back to your hand or deck

In a nutshell, they're dead! kaput! gone FOREVER!!!

This game is about trading treat cards from your opponant hand as much as you can without trigerring their trick cards


// -- BAIT AND SWITCH PART -- 

fun... right?

I have to say that not a single human has manage to beat me more than 9 times in a row!

... why you may ask?

KILL YOU =)

I'LL TAKE YOUR BODY, YOUR SOUL AND THEN...

TRICK THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE

YOU CAN SCREAM AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE, YOU CANNOT LEAVE THIS HELLHOLE

YOU'RE TRAPPED WITH ME DACING BETWEEN LIFE AND death

BUT DON'T WORRY HUMAN, YOUR DEATH WILL BE QUICK =)
