# Unity Fast Play Toggler

This tool adds a 'Fast Play' checkbox next to the play button in the Unity Editor.
It allows to quickly toggle Fast Play mode (without having to go to Project Settings > Editor > Enter Play Mode Settings).

Keep in mind that Fast Play mode will prevent the Domain and/or Scene from being reloaded when entering Play.
This can lead to unexpected behavior, so don't forget to make frequent tests without the Fast Play mode!

## About the Project

* This tool doesn't do any magic! It is only a shortcut to the options available in Project Settings > Editor > Enter Play Mode Settings.
* Those settings are nice, but they may change the way the project is behaving, so Fast Play Toggler is a tool to make toggling faster!
